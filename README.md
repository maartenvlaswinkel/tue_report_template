# tue_report_template
This template works best with [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/), [latexmk](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk) and an editor you like.

Simply run the command `latexmk` with a command prompt/terminal in the main folder of your report.

To change the name of the output file, change `<OUTPUT_NAME>` in the line '$jobname = '<OUTPUT_NAME>';' to wathever you like.
